# Bus Mall User Stories

As a member of the marketing research team, I want to track how many times my users select specific products.
I want to be able to see how many clicks that were made on each picture in the console, as well as in a table.
I want this information so that I can advertise similar products to them in the future.

As a developer, I want to set up three pictures next to each other for my users to select from. I want to generate three different pictures randomly after each selection for 25 times.
I also want to log their results in a table, showing them how many times they clicked on each item.

As a focus group participant, I want to be able to select between different pictures, and not see the same one twice.
I want to know how many times I have selected each picture, and show me my results when I am complete.
